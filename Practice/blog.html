            <p>
              Elias Wren was the last clockmaker in Greystone, a fog-bound town
              where the sea chewed at the cliffs and gulls screamed like
              restless spirits. His shop sat at the end of Hollow Street, tucked
              between a shuttered bakery and a pawnshop that never seemed open.
              The sign above his door—a painted brass clock face—had long lost
              its shine, but the rhythmic ticking within could be heard even
              from outside, like a steady heartbeat against the silence of the
              street.
              <br />
              Elias was old. His hands trembled when he worked, but the tremor
              never betrayed him when he touched the innards of a clock. Cogs,
              gears, and springs responded to him like students to a master. The
              townsfolk said he could coax a broken watch to life with nothing
              more than a glance, though Elias always laughed at such
              exaggerations. What they didn't know, however, was that he never
              truly repaired clocks.
              <br />
              He gave them time.
              <br />
              It had begun decades ago, when his wife, Maren, lay ill in their
              small apartment above the shop. He had prayed, begged, and
              bargained with anyone who might hear. In desperation, he opened
              one of his clocks—an old mantelpiece piece his father had left
              him—and whispered a plea into its hollow frame: Take my time, give
              it to her. The pendulum stilled, then began to swing again with
              renewed vigor. Maren awoke the next morning, color returned to her
              cheeks.
              <br />
              From then on, Elias understood the strange bond between his life
              and the clocks he tended. He could pour days, weeks, sometimes
              even years of his own time into a mechanism, and when he returned
              the watch or clock, the owner seemed lighter, healthier, luckier.
              He never explained. They never asked.
              <br />
              But time, as always, collected its debts.
              <br />
              On a gray November morning, as rain streaked down his windows, a
              girl appeared in his doorway. She could not have been older than
              twelve, with hair like copper wire and eyes too large for her pale
              face. She clutched a small wooden clock, cracked across the face.
              <br />
              “Please,” she whispered, voice raw. “It belonged to my brother.
              He… he's gone, and it's all I have.”
              <br />
              Elias felt the familiar ache in his chest. He motioned her inside,
              took the clock into his hands, and examined it. The glass was
              shattered, the gears stiff from neglect. But he could feel the
              thrum beneath it—the faint, dying pulse of time waiting to be
              reignited.
              <br />
              “What's your name, child?” he asked.
              <br />
              “Lena.”
              <br />
              “And your brother?”
              <br />
              Her eyes filled with tears. “Thomas. He drowned last winter.”
              <br />
              Elias's throat tightened. He could not return the dead. That was
              the one rule he had learned, the hard way. Yet as he looked at
              Lena, shivering in the dim shop, he wondered if perhaps he could
              ease her burden. A memory, a warmth, a fragment of the boy she
              loved—maybe that could be given.
              <br />
              He told her to come back the next day. When she left, her small
              boots splashing in puddles, Elias sat before the clock and closed
              his eyes. He felt the gears resist as he opened the casing, and he
              whispered, Take from me. Give her what comfort you can.
              <br />
              Hours passed. His hands grew weak. His breath shortened. The
              pendulum began to move.
              <br />
              When Lena returned the following morning, the clock ticked softly
              in his hands. She held it to her chest and smiled, radiant.
              <br />
              “I can hear him,” she said. “It's like he's laughing again.”
              <br />
              Elias smiled back, though his vision blurred. He waved her off
              before she could notice the tremor in his limbs.
              <br />
              That night, Elias dreamed of Maren. She stood by the sea, her hair
              blown by the wind, her hand outstretched. “You've given so much,”
              she whispered. “But time runs one way, love. Even for you.”
              <br />
              The following weeks blurred together. More people came—word of his
              miracles spread quickly. Watches, pocket clocks, heirlooms, each
              carried stories of sorrow and longing. Elias poured himself into
              them, piece by piece, day by day. His hair whitened, his skin grew
              paper-thin, and his shop filled with the sound of ticking, like a
              hundred small hearts beating in unison.
              <br />
              One evening, Lena returned again. She looked brighter now,
              healthier, as though her grief had loosened its grip.
              <br />
              “I wanted to thank you,” she said, setting the clock gently on his
              counter. “But also… to ask. Are you all right?”
              <br />
              Elias chuckled, though it came out hollow. “Just an old man,
              child. Old men always look tired.”
              <br />
              She studied him with sharp eyes, then leaned closer. “Thomas would
              have said you look like someone who's running out of time.”
              <br />
              The words pierced him. He pressed the clock back into her hands.
              “Then keep this close. It will guide you, when you need it.”
              <br />
              That night, as rain lashed against the windows, Elias felt his
              strength ebb for the last time. The clocks in his shop all slowed,
              as though mourning with him. He sat in his chair, listening to the
              symphony of ticking, until one by one, they stilled.
              <br />
              When morning came, the townsfolk found the shop silent. Elias sat
              slumped in his chair, peaceful, a faint smile on his lips. Every
              clock in the room had stopped at the same moment: midnight.
              <br />
              Years later, people would still tell the story of Elias Wren, the
              clockmaker who gave his time away. They would say his shop had
              been enchanted, that he bargained with angels, or perhaps with the
              sea itself.

              <br />But Lena knew better. She kept the wooden clock on her
              bedside, its steady tick reminding her of kindness, of sacrifice,
              of a man who had traded pieces of his life so others might carry
              on. And whenever she felt lost, she would place her ear against
              its face, and swear she heard not only her brother's laughter but
              Elias's voice, gentle and steady, whispering:
              <br />
              Time moves forward. So must you.
